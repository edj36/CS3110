(* Algorithm: 
  1. check if word is in scrabble dictionary
  2. go to start coordinates and face in the right direction, make string 
     going till end of board
  3. for length of the string entered:
    - check tile @ position in string you just made, if occupied, make sure 
      it equals the corresponding letter in string entered 
    - if not occupied, fill it with next character in string entered 
      (first check that that character is available in the player's rack) 
  4. once at end of string, check next tile 
    - if empty, return true 
    - if there is a letter there, add the letter to the word, then check if this 
      new word is in the scrabble dictionary 
    - if the word is not in scrabble dictionary return false, if it is, 
      repeat step 4. 
  5. derefence and make a copy of state, then call kenta's helper function with the 
    copy of state and string entered, this will return a list of the words it creates
    on the board. Loop through this list, check if each word is in scrabble dictionary
    if any is not, return false, else if you get to end of list return true.
  6. check that center is covered
