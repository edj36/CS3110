(* [check_char] represents bool type, indicating if all elements in char List

(* [validate] is a bool representation indicating if the move is valid or not
 * check following criteria
 * - the word is made only by the letters in the hands (Done)
 * - the check if word fits in the board
 * - TODO the new words is a valid word in dictionary
 * - TODO when it's turn 1, you have to place over (H,8)
 * - TODO new words have to satisfy one of following rules
 *   1, Adding one or more letters to a word or letters already on the board
 *     (only case that you can play 1 letter)
 *   2, Placing a word at right angles to a word already on the board
 *   3, Placing a complete word parallel to a word already played
      so that adjacent letters also form complete words *)
