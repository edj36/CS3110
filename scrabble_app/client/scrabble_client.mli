(* [get_state] will be called during the "busy wait" that each player
 * does when its not their turn. The function always sends the same
 * GET request to the server and returns the state object the
 * server currently has. The player can then check this object to see
 * if its their turn. *)

(* [post_move] sends the [move] and current [state] to the server via a
 * POST request, and represents the new state resulting from executing
 * [move] in [state] *)
