    ==== Game Play ====
Scrabble is a popular board game in which players score points by placing tiles
that spell out words onto a 15 x 15 game board. Words either flow from left to
right in rows or downwards in columns.\n
    ==== Scoring ====
Each tile is assigned a point value and positions on the board may have one of
four bonus values (double letter, triple letter, double word, and triple word).
The total point value of a word is the sum of the individual tiles that make up
the word. A tile played on a double or triple letter position multiplies the point
value of the tile by the appropriate amount, while a word with any tile placed in a
double or triple word position multiplies the total point value of the word.
The total point value of the move is the total point value of the word with any
bonus multipliers factored in. \n
    ==== Turns ====
Each turn, a player has the option to play a word (either across or down), shuffle
their rack, switch out tiles from their rack, or pass. If all the players pass
during a cycle, the game ends. Playing a word requires players to use only the
letters from their rack and available letters on the board. The word played must
be adjacent to at least one tile currently on the board, and all new words by the
move must be valid according to the scrabble dictionary. \n
    ==== Conclusion ====
A game ends if all the letters are used up and the players cannot play a valid
move with the letters currently in their racks, or if one player uses up all their
letters and the bag is empty. Alternatively, the game ends if all the players
pass in a given cycle. The player with the highest scores wins the game. \n\n"
